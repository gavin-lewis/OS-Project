# OS-Project
Repository for Operating System Project (Linux Shell)

The Code uses Linux Shell Scripting to transalate various operations that can be done on the Linux shell

The Code is designed as a basic template to design your own commands as an overlay over the linux shell commands. The program is also capable of detecting and running linux shell commands also.

Note: The read operation in the code is only designed to understand the storage of data. It does not produce any output on the screen. The read operation is used in conjunction with other operations such as print, etc.
